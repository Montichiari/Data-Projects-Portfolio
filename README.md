A summary and collection of my data analysis and data science projects.

## [Project 1: Employee Turnover Data Analysis and  Tree-based Prediction Models](https://github.com/Montichiari/Employee-Turnover-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Model-Project)
In this capstone project, I used python and libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit learn, matplotlib, and seaborn to clean and perform exploratory data analysis on the provided employee survey dataset. Potential reasons for employee turnover were uncovered, and Random Forest and XGBoost models were created to predict if an employee left the company based on their survey results. The models were then tuned with GridSearchCV, evaluated, and then compared to decide which was stronger. I then came up with recommendations based on the results of the analysis and performance of the models.

## [Project 2: Fitbit User Data Analysis Project](https://github.com/Montichiari/Fitbit-User-Data-Analysis-Project)
For this project, a dataset which contained the usage information of 33 Fitbit users was cleaned, transformed, and then analysed using R. Usage behaviour such as frequency of use for sleep tracking, weight logging, and general usage was first analysed. This was followed by an analysis of user health metrics, such as exercise hours per week, hours asleep, and time taken to fall asleep. By identifying patterns in usage behaviour and by profiling users based on their health metrics, recommendations for marketing and product development were crafted.
